OVERVIEW
========

This bundle allows you to place your website in maintenance mode.

A page with status code 503 appears to users, several ways to authorize via the configuration.

Several choices of maintenance modes are possible: a simple test of an existing file, memcache, or in a database via Doctrine ORM.
